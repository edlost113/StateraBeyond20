# Release Notes

v2.15.0 (July 13th 2025)
===

Hi,

Time for another Beyond20 update, with many fixes and some exciting new features as well!

In this update, we're adding support for Foundry v13, which was recently released. I know many of you have been eager to use Beyond20 with the new v13 update! Thanks to [@sirrio](https://github.com/sirrio) for contributing the fix!

Another cool feature I'm excited about is the ability to lock/unlock some of the per-character settings. This feature, brought to you by [@dmportella](https://github.com/dmportella), would allow you, for example, to enable Sneak Attack only for the next roll, or enable Great Weapon Master permanently, so it doesn't reset after each attack.

There are many other improvements in this release, check out the full [Changelog](/Changelog#v2150) to see all the changes.

As usual, a big thank you to our contributors, as well as to my generous [Patrons](https://patreon.com/kakaroto) and [Ko-fi/Github](/rations) supporters. 

Have fun!
