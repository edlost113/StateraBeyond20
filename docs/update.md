# Release Notes

v2.13.1 (February 19th 2025)
===

Hi,

We're releasing today a hotfix release as D&D Beyond have changed their site and the HP syncing fix from last week's release already needed to be rewritten.

This hotfix release fixes HP syncing as well as the missing description when displaying actions.

Thanks and enjoy!

v2.13.0 (February 13th 2025)
===

Hi everyone,

With the release last week of the new Monster Manual 2024, we have seen the introduction of a new statblock format to the monsters!
Today's update adds support for the new 2024 monster stat blocks, as well as adds a couple of small bugfixes.

Check out the full [Changelog](/Changelog#v2130) to see all the changes added in this release.

As usual, a big thank you to [@dmportella](https://linktr.ee/dmportella) as well as to my generous [Patrons](https://patreon.com/kakaroto) and [Ko-fi/Github](/rations) supporters. 

P.S: The version 2.13.0 being released on February 13th is purely a coincidence! :D

Enjoy.
