# Release Notes

v2.16.1 (September 2nd 2025)
===

This is a small hotfix for yesterday's release, due to a bug when rolling attacks with the Rogue's Sneak Attack option enabled.

v2.16.0 (August 31st 2025)
===

Hi,

We're releasing today a small Beyond20 update which has fixes for Psy Warrior attacks, Reckless Attacks as well as fixing rolls made with D&D Beyond's interface for rolling with advantage/disadvantage.

This update also adds support for the Rogue's Assassinate class feature from the 2024 rules, which behaves differently from the 2014 PHB rules for Assassinate.

As usual, a big thank you to [@dmportella](https://github.com/dmportella) for his changes, as well as to my generous [Patrons](https://patreon.com/kakaroto) and [Ko-fi/Github](/rations) supporters. 

Enjoy!
