## Support me?

Oh, you want to help support the development of this extension (and more), how nice! You can do so by either contributing in some way (telling your friends about it, reporting bug reports, suggesting awesome features or contributing to the code) or, like many others who have helped make this project a possibility, you can support me on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/kakaroto), [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/kakaroto).

<div>
{% include_relative buttons/patreon.html %} &nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&nbsp;

{% include_relative buttons/github.html %}
</div>

If however, you do not want to use Patreon or Github Sponsors or don't want to pledge on them for any reason, but still want to support this project financially, you can do so by buying me a ration on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/kakaroto) using [PayPal](https://paypal.me/KaKaRoTo) or a credit card (no signup necessary).

## Help, support and issues

Oh, I misunderstood, you're the ones in need of support! Well, fear not, I am here to help!

If you want to ask for help, give feedback or discuss an issue, you can join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/ZAasSVS).

If you've found a bug or have an issue with Beyond20, or if you have a feature or suggestion to make, you can head over to github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/kakaroto/Beyond20/issues) and submit your bug report or feature request by creating a new issue. 

Alternatively, in case you're not familiar to github (and don't want to create an account there), if you just let me know about your request on Discord, I will take care of creating the issue for you.
